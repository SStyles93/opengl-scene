# GPR5300 - ComputerGraphics

This project was done at the SAE Institute Geneva during the GPR5300-ComputerGraphics module.
The project is a grouping of all the code done while learning [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) and its creation 
is resumed in my blogpost that you can find [here](https://sstyles93.github.io/).

The project contains:

-	[Data](https://github.com/SStyles93/opengl-scene/tree/main/data)
	Contains the shaders used for the project. You can download the textures and objects [here]().	

-	[Include](https://github.com/SStyles93/opengl-scene/tree/main/include) 
	Contains all the header files

-	[Main](https://github.com/SStyles93/opengl-scene/tree/main/main)
	Contains all the Scenes that illustrate the different steps of OpenGL

-	[Src](https://github.com/SStyles93/opengl-scene/tree/main/src)
	Contains all the .cpp files

Note that this project was built using [CMake](https://cmake.org/) and [VCPKG](https://vcpkg.io/en/).
